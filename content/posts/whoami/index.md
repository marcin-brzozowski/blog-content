I'm thrilled to welcome you to my Blog. I hope that you will find here some content of interest to you, and that we'll be seeing each other from time to time!

In this very first blog post, I'd like to introduce myself, so that you know what type of person you're dealing with here üòé.

My name is Marcin, I was born and live in Poland, currently dwelling in Gda≈Ñsk. At the moment of writing this post, I'm 28 years old. I love to spend my free time with my wife, ferocious cat Lili and our puppy - Yeti, the White Swiss Shepherd. Apart from that I love playing strategic board games and do sports, especially tennis, swimming and football. Ok, I guess that's enough of the off-topic.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer. However, it's hard to precisely label myself, as I'm interested in many different topics: backend, DevOps, software architecture etc. In general, I'm a big tech enthusiast and this is going to be the main theme of this blog. I try to educate myself on a daily basis, and I would love to share my experience and ideas with you. The other reason for creating this blog was to use it as a memory dump for my brain üòÅ. It's challenging to keep all the information in your mind, struggling not to forget the bits and pieces as time passes.

I think that's enough of my jibber-jabber. If you're still reading this, then I'm grateful for the time you spent here, and let's hope we'll meet again in the next posts.

Cheers!
